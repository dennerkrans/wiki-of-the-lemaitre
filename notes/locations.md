Following the widescale destruction of the major super powers in World War 3, Belgium rose up and began to annex its neighbors starting with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Under the newfound military might of Brussels, the three nations were subjugated under _The New Belgium Republic_. Decesive victories in Scandinavia, Germany and France cemented the military might of the newly formed republic, and other countries were forced to willingly submit or face the military power of New Belgium. 

Although formally a republic, corruption ran rife in New Belgium, meaning that it was more of an oligarchy in practice. Eventually one corporation came to so thoroughly dominate the empire, that it became the defacto political entity. Its powers unchecked by the figurehead government - __Waffablast__ created its own armies, secured and monopolized all markets and insituted a puritan Belgophile regime. The tendrils of its soft power can be felt in all aspects of New Belgian life, and its hard power can be seen easily by the troops and military installations littering the entire republic. 

### History in Brief

__Coca Cola Uprising__ the Vassal States of America attempted an uprising in 2043, where the workers banded under one of the few remaining icons of the American Empire, the Coca Cola logo. They managed to sabotage 2 Waffablast facilities before the revolt was brought to a swift and bloody conclusion. The symbol has since then been banned. 

__The New Periodic Table__ by 2032 new Belgian scientists working for Waffablast discovered a new element, __WA__, the smooth element giving Waffablast sodas their distinct flavor. The discovery won the nobel prizes in chemistry, physics, biology and literature the same year. 

# The Lemâitre
The Lemâitre is a generation 1.8, Ronroner astral-ferry class. Other ships of the line included the TinTin launched in 2045 and the Asterix and Obelix launched the subsequent year. The class was quickly disbanded due to a slew of mechanical and software issues following the destruction of the Obelix on re-entry into the atmosphere. The remaining ships were put into storage and deemed unsafe for further travel. 
# KE55
Out in the Kepler Belt, KE55 is a class 3 dormant helio-asteriod, unremarkable save for an earlier mission having gone missing in the vicinity and some strange energy readings.
