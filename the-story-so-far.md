# The Journal of the Lemâitre
## Confusion and in company violence
A mysterious planet with weird looking aliens. An unprovoked offence is the best defence. Turned out to be a simulation. Oops. Introduction to WaffleBlast Inc and New Belgium. Afterwork, scam artist, and a "mission".
## Excommunicated to KE55
Travel to KE55 for a mining survey. Buddy, Wrench, Fred, Elomny, and Jorana the mysterious rude one. A 6 month trip. Jorana's cryotube is set to wake up a day early, and the realization that she is up to no good. Wrench waking up even earlier to snoop. Waking up finding a lot of books in ancient german (were the prohibited?). A bunch of mining equipment. The ships sensors find a huge energy source on KE55. The waking up of the rest, and the sudden disappearance of Sanna.
## Shanniqua, Struwwelpeter, and the light
We've landed on KE55. Everyone except Buddy follow Jorana down on the asteroid heading towards the energy source. She tells us of her devious plans using this strange power source, the light of creation (?), to alter the world in favor of WaffleBlast Inc. Wrench attempts to stop her by tackling her causing her to drop the book Struwwelpeter into the light. Oops. A huge wave of reality twisting energy was launched towards earth as we were knocked down.
## A Buddy lost, and a buddy found
Before we can react Jorana is bolting towards the Lemâitre marroning us on KE55. She kidnapped Buddy. We try to find a way back to earth, back to the Lemâitre to save Buddy. Old decrepit space ship from the ESA. A lot of dead people inside, one alive, Aris.
## Touchdown in tooth town
The brave heroes and their newfound friend flew the spaceship back to earth where they crashlanded. Finding a lazy village sadly devoid of true entrepreneurship, a not alltogether toothless murder mystery arose. Various forms of mold were obtained using morally unscrupoulus methods and several fedora tricks were performed in the process to the sheer amazement of the masses. A taxing series of trials faced the heroes in a dungeon which eventually led to the battle with psychotic Tooth Fairy which the party soundly defeated gaining useful new powers and armor. Later it was found out that the Tooth Fairy sadly seemed to have been the only entrepreneur of the region and following his departure any faint hope of enterprise of the otherwise impoverished region might have clung to was violently crushed, thus halting progress in its infancy.
