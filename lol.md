# Cities of Reinlandia
## Background
Reinlandia sits nestled in between a diverse array of different states, with the acquatic France to the West and the Helvetic Republic to the South, Reinlandia has emerged as somewhat of a center of commerce and trade. As of such cities have grown up around this trade. 

## Schlangdorf - Capital

> **Ode an die Stadt auf dem grünen Hügel**
> _Schlangdorf thront prächtig auf einem Hügel von reinem Grün,
>  ihre Schönheit, ihre Anmut vibriert wie die alten Königinnen.   
>  Oh Shlangdorf, Shlangdorf, 
>  mein Herz,
>  mein Zuhause, 
>  meine Liebe, 
>  lass mir in deinem weichen Busen sterben._

> __Ode to the city on the green hillock (Translated from original common)__
> _Schlangdorf sits resplendent upon a hill of pure green, 
> her beauty, her grace vibrates like the queens of old. 
> Oh Shlangdorf, Shlangdorf, 
> my heart,   
> my home,  
> my love,   
> let me die in your soft bosom._  

The bleeding heart of Reinlandia, Schlangdorf sits in a nexus of rivers, controlling most of the major pathways for trade in and out of Reinlandia. 

## Cities of Industry

### Tesseralia

__Tesseralia__ is dubbed the city of Dreams by people that know it, and a fun weekend outing by those who don't. It's is a tiered city, divided into several distinct and different districts roughly cut down the lines of social class and hierarchy.  Although the city is so rigidly divided along class lines and the difference between the top and bottom classes are so large, there is never any social strife. The families made sure of that. 

#### The Four Families
__Tesseralia__ is a city of industry, it is ruled by oligarchic families called _the four_. While there exists a largely ceremonial title as Mayor, everybody knows that the real power switches between one of the four families depending on their changing power and influence that month.  

##### The Fallisch Family 
The Fallisch family are the current dominant family, their stranglehold on the vapor industry guarantees them a steady stream of money. Head of the family is Henrietta Fallisch, who came to power after her grandfather died in a falling accident. Specifically from the top of the Fallisch University tower, which looms over the city. Since his death, the Fallisch family has reasserted their power over Tesseralia, usurping much of the power formerly held by the Schweinstütz family.  In what is widely seen as a move to further cement their power over the city, the family is prone to wed their son Harry with the daughter of a highly placed military family. 

##### The Schweinstütz family
The Schweinstütz family call themselves the stewards and engineers of Tesseralia. A statement that rings largely true, as they architected much of the infrastructure in the city, and ensuring that every part of it required Knallgas to run. A fuel that they also happened to supply. Their power can be seen mostly in the poorer district, where almost everybody is a benefactor of the Schweinstütz industrial benevolence. However, much of their power has waned. A slow decline started with Karl Schweinstütz and it is one that has only been accelerated by the presence of Rcnum nearby, which looks to be able to replace much of the city's reliance on Knallgas.  The current head of the family is Heinrich Schweinstütz.
