# Backstory
Born Charlie Bartholomew Ren 34 years ago according to the New Belgium Date System. Charlie grew up watching his mother Scala create mechanical wonders in her Emporium of Arcane Machinations and Thingamabobs, so it was only natural that Charlie followed in her footsteps. From the day he was old enough to hold a wrench and screw a nut he helped out, learned, and created. During this time combinations of the arcane and technological were works of wonder and amazement, but sadly that dwindled over time as New Belgium, fearing this arcane technology and the creativity it brought, strangled the market by applying extreme taxation on purchases of such wares.

In the end the Emporium of Arcane Machinations and Thingamabobs turned into the Nut & Bolt: Fixers of Home Appliances For Whatever Sprouts You’re Willing to Pay, a way too long of a name to afford buying any type of advertisement so in the end Charlie and his mother made due by helping the local community as general handymen. That however was simply the day job.

Scala together with Charlie continued pursuing the way of the Artificer. Hell bent on creating something that could change the world for the better and finally showing the wonders this art could bring the citizens of New Belgium. So they started working on the Wish Engine, that later upon its incomplete completion was renamed the Serendipity Engine due to its unintended serendipitous nature, a device that would have the power to alter reality, both space and time.

The test that ended the project prematurely was the day that Charlie lost his arm. He was now in his late teens and the beta version of the Wish Engine was ready to be tested but something went fairly wrong. The engine seemingly had a mind of its own and instead of waiting for a wish it surged with a brilliant light. Charlie who had pressed the big red button got his left arm enveloped in this orb and with no pain, simply a feeling of loss his left forearm was gone. The work on the Wish Engine, now renamed the Serendipity Engine, ceased that day.

The years moved on and Charlie grew up to be a young man. He had spent the past year creating a one of a kind arcane cybernetic arm to replace what he had lost, and in many ways it made him more of the man he is today. During his experiments creating the Thunder Cannon he took the help of a young bio-engineer Nima Ulyssa Thiel, or Nut for short, and working closely together to create a proper prosthetic they ended up becoming more than colleagues. The following years were the best in his life, he felt at peace. 

But sadly it didn’t last forever, and due to his stubbornness and thickheadedness he lost Nut and little Brian Olfric Lamont Thiel, his son.
