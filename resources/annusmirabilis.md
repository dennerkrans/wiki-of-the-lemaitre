## Book 1
### Chapter 1 - Out with the Horribilis
> Edited by Aris Doe-Katz

Breakur work up slowly, painfully, clutching his aching skull. It was the first day of the next miserable year of Breakur's life... He had lost his crown. His once great empire had been extinguished like a match in rain. Taken from him by people who either feared or were unable to comprehend the full depth of his love. How he had survived when his brother Prag had stormed halberd in hand into his throne room and deposed him he did not know. Gingerly, he tried to raise his naked body up from the muddy puddle he found himself in. He looked down at his naked body, even caked with mud his body looked taut, tan and tasty. His arms flexed, watermelon sized muscles bulging, caked mud falling off as he strained his muscles. For a second he stared transfixed at the his rippling, bulging arms and it was with a start that he felt something licking his speckled green thighs. He whipped around, seeing as he did a lone goat that must have mistaken him for some foliage. The goat bleeted at him.

The sun was setting when he finished off the final leg of the goat. A final ray of sunshine caught and lingered on his naked chest, sparkling there for a second, glistening on the oil drippings from the fresh meat.
