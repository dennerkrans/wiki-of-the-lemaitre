## Book 1
### Chapter 1 - Out with the Horribilis
> Edited by Aris Doe-Katz

Breakur work up slowly, painfully, clutching his aching skull. It was the first day of the next miserable year of Breakur's life... He had lost his crown. His once great empire had been extinguished like a match in rain. Taken from him by people who either feared or were unable to comprehend the full depth of his love. How he had survived when his brother Prag had stormed halberd in hand into his throne room and deposed him he did not know. Gingerly, he tried to raise his naked body up from the muddy puddle he found himself in. He looked down at his body, even caked with mud his body looked taut, tan and tasty. His arms flexed, watermelon sized muscles bulging, caked mud falling off as he muscles strained.
